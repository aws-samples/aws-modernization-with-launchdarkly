## Create a LaunchDarkly account

LaunchDarkly provides a 14-day trial for users to explore LaunchDarkly capabilities. To execute the tasks within this workshop, you'll need to create a LaunchDarkly account. 

1 . Sign up for a free LaunchDarkly account through the AWS Marketplace [page](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-x22m6p4lybzwe?trk=el_a134p000003yrYeAAI&trkCampaign=AWSMP_pdp_dev_x_dg&sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=el_awsmp_mult&sc_outcome=Marketplace)

After creating your LaunchDarkly account and logging in, you'll be placed in your default project.

2 . Navigate to the [Account settings/Projects tab](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects) and copy the **client-side ID** for the Test environment -- this will be used as a part of the App Runner configuration

The SDK keys on this page enable the LaunchDarkly SDKs to communicate back with the LaunchDarkly service. Integrating these SDKs allows your application to pull down feature flags values from the globally distributed Flag Delivery Network.
