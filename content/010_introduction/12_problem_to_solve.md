# What Is The Challenge/Problem?
In traditional software releases, functionality is released at the time of the software is deployed. We deploy our code to an environment, and when users access it, the entire application is available for them to consume. This approach carries a lot of risk. Users consume all of the features of the application you've released, bugs and all. If larger problem arise in the rolled out version, its either emergency triage or a rollback (the redeployment of a previous version). Furthermore, the problem is impacting potentially your entire user community. We refer to this as the "blast radius".  

These outages can carry a huge cost - both financially and operationally. They impact developer productivity, diminish your teams morale, slow the pace of innovation, and hurt the confidence of the business in developer teams.
