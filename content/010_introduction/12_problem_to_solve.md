# What Is The Challenge/Problem?
Traditional software releases are risky and stressful. When developers deploy code to production, that code gets released to the whole user base at the same time. In this scenario, incidents that occur affect a large audience. What's more, resolving such incidents often involves emergency fixes, rollbacks, and redeploys, some of which can be expensive and time-intensive. These risks hurt developer productivity, diminish team morale, and slow the pace of innovation.
