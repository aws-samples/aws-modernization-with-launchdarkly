# What is LaunchDarkly?

LaunchDarkly is a feature management platform that empowers all teams to safely deliver and control software through feature flags. Feature flags are if-else statements that decouple code deployments from feature releases, giving you control over which end-users see which features. LaunchDarkly allows teams to leverage the power of feature flags on a massive scale across a variety of complex use cases. The ability to separate deployments from releases allows developers to safely ship code to production whenever they want, at the same time, allowing the business to release that code to end-users when they're ready.
