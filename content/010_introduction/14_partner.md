# What is LaunchDarkly?

LaunchDarkly is a feature management platform that empowers all teams to safely deliver and control software releases through feature flags. Feature flags are if-else statements that break apart application code, allowing the deployment of the application to be separated from the release of features. This separation allows teams to reduce the blast radius of their deployments by targeting releases at specific user cohorts. Developers, Product Managers, SRE's, and Marketing teams can leverage LaunchDarkly to gradually rollout software functionality to their teams - increasing their release agility and reducing risk.  

LaunchDarkly allows teams to leverage the power of feature flags on a massive scale across a variety of complex use cases. The ability to separate deployments from releases allows developers to safely ship code to production whenever they want, without impacting existing users, and allows platform operators to release features gradually.
