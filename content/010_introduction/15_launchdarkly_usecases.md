# What else can we do with LaunchDarkly?

When we look at [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/), it's important to start by asking the question "What is a feature?". Sometimes a feature release is as simple as changing the look at feel of a webpage. It could be rolling out new capabilities to a mobile device application. It could also be migrating to a new API layer, or database environment. Ultimately - a feature is simply functionality thats present in your application - regardless of the consumer of it. [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/) enables all of these use cases and more to deliver these changes to end user teams. 

To integrate across these applications, LaunchDarkly offers [25 different]((https://launchdarkly.com/features/sdk/)) Software Development Kits (SDKs) for common languages and platforms.

Moving beyond the "toggle on and off" feature, [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/) allows users to automate these rollouts via Workflows, configure groups of users via segments, or make data driven decisions around feature releases leveraging experimentation.
