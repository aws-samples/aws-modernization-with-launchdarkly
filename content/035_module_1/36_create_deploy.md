[AWS App Runner](https://aws.amazon.com/apprunner/) allows us to run web based applications directly on AWS without managing underlying infrastructure. Services can be deployed by simply connecting a Git repository or specifying a container to run. 

## Setting up the AWS App Runner Service

Open the AWS console, and browse to the [AWS App Runner service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/home) and select **Create an App Runner service**.

For your Repository type, select **Source code repository**. This will require you to add a connection to GitHub in order for AWS App Runner to deploy your new service. Select **Add new**. New window to configure GitHub cionnections will be open, and either you can select GitHub app if you already set it before, or you will be promted to install AWS Connector for GitHub. Pick the app\profile you used to create the fork. In the **Repository** drop down select the name of the fork `ld-aws-devops-workshop`.

Underneath Deployment trigger, select **Automatic** in order to automatically redeploy your application whenever a code change is pushed to the main branch of your Github repository, then select **Next**.

For this example, we are going to specify all the settings for our service manually. This is in order to show the control that AWS App Runner gives you. 

- Select **Configure all settings here**
- Underneath Runtime select **Nodejs 14** from the dropdown.
- Under Build commend, enter `npm install`
- Under Start command, enter `npm run start`
- Under Port, enter `3000`
- Select **Next** to continue.

On the next step we will provide 

- Service name `my-aws-workshop-app`
- Under Environment variables, click **Add environment variables**, and enter the Key as `REACT_APP_LD_CLIENT_ID`, and the value as the LaunchDarkly's *client-side ID* (Client-side ID from [AWS Test environment](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects/default/environments))

Leave the rest of these settings as defaults, and click **Next** to continue.

Once status has moved to "Running", you can click on the URL listed below *Default domain* in order to view the actual web application you have just deployed.

Congratulations, you have just deployed a simple web service using App Runner!
