[AWS App Runner](https://aws.amazon.com/apprunner/) allows us to run web based applications directly on AWS without managing underlying infrastructure. Services can be deployed by simply connecting a Git repository or specifying a container to run. 

## Setting up the AWS App Runner Service

Open the AWS console, and browse to the [AWS App Runner service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/home) and select **Create an App Runner service**.

For your Repository type, select **Source code repository**. This will require you to add a connection to GitHub in order for AWS App Runner to deploy your new service. Select **Add new**.

Underneath Deployment trigger, select **Automatic** in order to automatically redeploy your application whenever a code change is pushed to the main branch of your Github repository, then select **Next**.

For this example, we are going to specify all the settings for our service manually. This is in order to show the control that AWS App Runner gives you. Select **Configure all settings here**, then underneath Runtime select **Nodejs 14** from the dropdown.

- Under Build commend, enter `npm install`
- Under Start command, enter `npm run start`
- Under Port, enter `3000`
- Select **Next** to continue.

On the next step we will provide 

- Service name `my-aws-workshop-app`
- Under Environment variables, enter the Key as `REACT_APP_LD_CLIENT_ID`, and the value as the LaunchDarkly's *client-side ID* (see [Launchdakly Account Setup](030_getting_started/31_setup_ld_account.html))

Leave the rest of these settings as defaults, and click **Next** to continue.

Once status has moved to â€œComplete", you can click on the URL listed below *Default domain* in order to view the actual web application you have just deployed.

Congratulations, you have just deployed a simple web service using App Runner!
