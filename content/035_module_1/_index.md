# YOUR FIRST LAUNCHDARKLY FEATURE FLAG

### Welcome

In this workshop we will learn to perform a "dark release" of a new feature in our demo application using AWS App Runner.

At your company, ABC, you are releasing a new custom dashboard and your mission is to deliver this new feature as reliably, quickly and safely as you can. Using a LaunchDarkly feature flag, you will be able to decouple release from deploy and dynamically manage this feature release through a feature flag.
