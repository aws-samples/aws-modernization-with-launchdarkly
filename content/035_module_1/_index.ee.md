# YOUR FIRST LAUNCHDARKLY FEATURE FLAG

### Welcome

In this workshop we will learn to perform a feature release of new features in our demo application, while its running live on AWS App Runner. Once we learn how to create and release features, we'll leverage user targeting to influence which users can consume additonal features. This method of software release is referred to as "dark launching" and it allows developers to release code to different user cohorts without changing their expereince or redeploying the application code. 

In our applicatiom, we'll use these feature flags to demonstrate delivering these new features reliably, quickly and safely.

In the next steps we'll step through deploying our demo application into AWS App runner. 

### Learning Objectives
- How to set up AWS App Runner and deploy an application
- How to use a feature flag to decouple release from deploy
- How to deliver business value rapidly by releasing new features and functionality to customers faster
