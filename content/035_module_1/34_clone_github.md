## Fork the source repository

Fork this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly-labs/ld-aws-devops-workshop) by launching the link and selecting the "Fork" button on the top right corner of the repository. This repo contains the application which will be used by App Runner as the source code repository (AWS Connector is used here). 

A "Fork" is a standalone copy of the existing repository, in your own Git environment, that you can modify independently of the original code. Developer teams will often fork a project repository, and create "Branches" (copies of the code separate from the "main" code base) to perform development work against.

Did you know that you can explore the application code right from your browser window? Open the github repository and press the . (the period) key on your keyboard, an IDE (integrated developer experience) will launch and you will be able to explore the code for the application.
