In order to leverage LaunchDarkly, we need to configure Feature Flags that can be toggled on or off. One half of this configuration lives within your application code, and the other half lives within the LaunchDarkly platform. In this section, we will create our first feature flag in LaunchDarkly.

Want to see the feature flag in code? You can see the flag we are creating in this step [here starting on line 16](https://github.com/launchdarkly-labs/ld-aws-devops-workshop/blob/f14b5aed952035cc22161c366ee06a3c686352ba/src/App.js#L16). Remember, you can view this in an IDE by pressing the . key within the GitHub repository.

1. Name the feature flag `prodHeader` (which will also populate the Key with the `prodHeader` value). Provide a description, and check the box for [*SDKs using Client-side ID*](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/getting-started/feature-flags#making-flags-available-to-client-side-and-mobile-sdks). The rest of the page can be optionally filled out. Once you've completed, select **Save flag** on the bottom.

   The feature flag key must be named **prodHeader** to match what's in the deployed application and [the variable definition in the code](https://github.com/launchdarkly-labs/ld-aws-devops-workshop/blob/f14b5aed952035cc22161c366ee06a3c686352ba/src/App.js#L12)
