# AWS Marketplace DevOps Workshop Series Hands-on Lab with LaunchDarkly


### Welcome

This hands-on lab is part of the AWS Marketplace DevOps Workshop Series. In this lab, you will gain experience in using LaunchDarkly to release new features in an application using feature flags. You will create feature flags in LaunchDarkly, managing user targeting rules, and enable the feature based on those targets. You will also learn to deploy the application using GitHub and AWS App Runner.

LaunchDarkly is a feature management and experimentation platform that enables all teams to safely deliver and control software through feature flags.

LaunchDarkly is available in AWS Marketplace. AWS Marketplace is a digital software catalog that makes it easy to find, try, buy, deploy, and manage software that runs on AWS. AWS Marketplace has a broad and deep selection of ISV solutions that can help you build your ideal DevOps toolchain in the cloud.
